Supports getting ping results from remote PC in domain.\r\n## Motivation\r\nA multi-threaded ping tool based on WMI. Supports getting ping results from remote PC in domain (needs to be logged on as domain administrator). For example in a global company with multiple sites, for a person located in Hong Kong office, he / she can ping Singapore server from Sydney server without having to remotely connect to Sydney server first.\r\n## Screenshot\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12\" src=\"http://carlchang.blog.com/files/2015/12/Screenshot_QP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"390\" />\r\n## Language &amp; Requirement\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>VB application written in VB.net</li>\r\n\t<li>.Net framework 4.5 or above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n## Features\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Multi-threaded ping echos are sent to avoid having to wait for previous echos to return, delaying further echos to be sent.</li>\r\n\t<li>Automatically generating a list of domain controllers if the local host is in domain. To get ping results from remote host (most likely to be a DC), you need to log in with a domain administrator account or other accounts with permissions to remotely log in to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).</li>\r\n\t<li>A chart will be generated for each ping session as shown in the screenshot.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n## Note\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>None</li>\r\n</ul>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
